                p You're a bard with an agenda: forcing others to fight your battles for you. With tactics gameplay inspired by early chess variants and a roulette-roguelite campaign, the core mechanic is to charm other, stronger units with unique abilities to work together to defeat the magical Fae. And if some of them die along the way, well that just makes for a better story...
