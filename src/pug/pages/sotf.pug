                h3 What on earth is this!?
                p The Song of The Fae is an episodic turn-based tactics adventure inspired by ancient chess variants. 

                h3 Tell me more...

                p The Song of The Fae is a story of a selfish bard caught in the struggle between the Fae Pantheon, the FaeQueen and all of humanity. You will master WizardChess, a bizarre magical game invented by the Fae, that is equal parts speed-chess and roulette.

                p In WizardChess you must charm units to aid you in your battles then seconds later sacrifice them. Unlike Chess your units are ephemeral, the lineup constantly evolving with each turn that passes. Learning to shape this process is the key to surviving an encounter with the Fae.

                h3 WizardChess!?

                p Legend has it that the Fae, in order to ward off their eternal boredom, host a WizardChess tournament every year. Whoever is crowned champion is granted a single boon from the FaeQueen herself. And somehow you've ended up as a contestant. 

                p Never before has a mortal been given the chance to enter. Will you triumph or perish along the way? And what boon will you choose..?

                p To make it out alive you must face each of the Fae and defeat them at their own game. Perhaps you will even learn the truth about who they are along way the way. Each episode of The Song of The Fae brings with it unique restrictions and challenges that can only be overcome with new strategies, new units to command and plenty of luck.

                p See you in the Songlands.

                p 
                    strong The game is still very much in development and this is a public preview. It is not representative of the quality we are aiming for. Regardless, we'd love to know what you think! 

                h3 The Team

                p <a href="/">TwoPM</a> consists of Ben Follington (<a href="https://twitter.com/vivavolt">@vivavolt</a>) and Ricky James (<a href="https://twitter.com/iammonshushu">@iammonshushu</a>), both based in sunny Queensland, Australia. We've been best friends for about 15 years and have been making games for almost as long. Game design and long-term creative projects have become a central pillar in our lives, despite the fact we do most of our work on nights and weekends.

                p By day Ben is a software engineer & UI designer, while Ricky is a rural doctor. When it comes to games Ben is responsible for all things technical and pixel art while Ricky focuses on project vision, writing and design. As time goes on we plan to continuously improve our processes and our work, hopefully letting us make game development a bigger part of our lives than it already is.
