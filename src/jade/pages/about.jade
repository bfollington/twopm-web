                        | <a href="index">Two PM</a> is a game design collective who have been making games together for <span id="yearCount">_</span> years and for some reason haven't given up.

                    p It's about making things we love but not taking everything too seriously. We've always had a lot of other stuff to worry about other than making games, so we're usually making them in our free time.

                    p Making games for us is like the feeling of kicking back with an afternoon tea, coffee, beer (or other). We love it.
